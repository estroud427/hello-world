# hello-world
My first repository (awwwww)

I'm a man of contradictions. I was born and raised in Texas, yet I love and play ice hockey. I went to school for a marketing degree, yet I work in IT. I swore I'd never do "Computer Stuff", yet now I want to break into software development & enterprise architecture.....go figure
